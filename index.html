    <h3>Average Beginner Web Developer</h3>
    <p>Starting to learn stuff at classes was really boring. Missed everything. Couldn't focus. Now I am learning everything, bit by bit, one step at a time. Eventually I plan on becoming better and turn into a competent web developer, capable of adding this skill to my CV or curriculum vitae.</p>
