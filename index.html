        <h3>Average Beginner Web Developer</h3>
        <p>Starting to learn stuff at classes was really boring. Missed everything. Couldn't focus. Now I am learning everything, bit by bit, one step at a time. Eventually I plan on becoming better and turn into a competent web developer, capable of adding this skill to my CV or curriculum vitae.</p>

         <h3>Developing skills to become a professional</h3>
         <p>I learned basic HTML and CSS. It was a bit late, but I got around to it. Now I know the basic tags and can build a viewable website. Learned a few git commands as well, hence, this is visible in github. I want to get better, improve my skills to become much better.</p>
